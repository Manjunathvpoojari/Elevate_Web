## üõ†Ô∏è Web Development Internship Tasks

## ‚û°Ô∏è Task 1: Responsive Landing Page

**Project Overview**
- The task involved building a clean, responsive landing page with three main sections:
    - A header with a logo and navigation links.
    - A hero section featuring a main heading, a paragraph, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.
    - A footer with social links.

**Technologies Used**
- **HTML5:** For structuring the page content.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including colors, fonts, and layout.
- **Flexbox:** Used for flexible and efficient layouts.
- **Media Queries:** Implemented for full **responsiveness** across different screen sizes.

**How to View**
- Clone the Repository: `git clone [your-github-repo-link]`
- Open in VS Code: Open the project folder.
- Use Live Server: Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" to view the page.

**Deliverables**
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `style.css`: CSS file with all styling and responsiveness logic.
- `logo.jpg`: Logo image used in the header.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Task 2: To-Do List Web App (Front-end only)

**Project Overview**
- The application allows users to:
    - **Add** new tasks via an input field and a button.
    - **Mark** tasks as completed by clicking on them, which toggles a strike-through effect.
    - **Delete** tasks individually using a remove button.
- The UI updates instantly without requiring a page reload.

**Technologies Used**
- **HTML5:** For the basic structure, including the input field, add button, and the list container.
- **CSS3:** For styling the app, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** The core technology for all functionality, including event listeners, creating and appending new elements to the **DOM**, and dynamically toggling CSS classes.

**How to View**
The setup is the same as Task 1. Simply open the `index.html` file for Task 2 in your browser or use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

**Deliverables**
- `index.html`: HTML file for the To-Do list structure.
- `style.css`: CSS file for the app's visual design.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing all the functional logic.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Task 3: REST API to Manage a List of Books (Back-end)

**Project Overview**
- The objective was to build a simple **RESTful API** with full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage a list of books. Data is stored in memory to focus solely on API routing and HTTP methods.

**Key Endpoints Implemented**
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GET** | `/books` | Retrieves a list of all books. |
| **POST** | `/books` | Adds a new book to the list (Create). |
| **PUT** | `/books/:id` | Updates an existing book by its ID (Update). |
| **DELETE** | `/books/:id` | Removes a book from the list by its ID (Delete). |

**Technologies Used**
- **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** The web framework used for setting up the server, defining routes, and handling requests.
- **JSON Handling:** Parsing request bodies and sending structured responses.

**How to Test**
1.  **Initialize Project:** Run `npm init -y` and install Express: `npm install express`.
2.  **Run Server:** Execute the main file using `node server.js` (or `node app.js`).
3.  **Use Postman:** Test all four endpoints by sending requests to `http://localhost:3000/books` and verifying the responses.

**Deliverables**
- `package.json`: Project dependencies file.
- `server.js` (or `app.js`): The main Node.js file containing the Express server setup and all the route handlers.

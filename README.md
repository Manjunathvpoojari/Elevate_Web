# ‚û°Ô∏è Task 1: Responsive Landing Page

Project Overview
- The task involved building a clean, responsive landing page with three main sections:

- A header with a logo and navigation links.

- A hero section featuring a main heading, a paragraph, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.

- A footer with social links.

# Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the page content.

- CSS3: For styling, including colors, fonts, and layout.

- Flexbox: Used for flexible and efficient layouts.

- Media Queries: Implemented for full responsiveness across different screen sizes.

How to View
- Clone the Repository: git clone [your-github-repo-link]

- Open in VS Code: Open the project folder.

- Use Live Server: Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server" to view the page.

Deliverables
- index.html: Main HTML file.

- style.css: CSS file with all styling and responsiveness logic.

- logo.jpg: Logo image used in the header.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Task 2: To-Do List Web App (Front-end only)

# Project Overview
- The application allows users to:

- Add new tasks via an input field and a button.

- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, which toggles a strike-through effect.

- Delete tasks individually using a remove button.

- The UI updates instantly without requiring a page reload.

# Technologies Used
- HTML5: For the basic structure, including the input field, add button, and the list container.

- CSS3: For styling the app, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.

- Vanilla JavaScript: The core technology for all functionality, including event listeners, creating and appending new elements to the DOM, and dynamically toggling CSS classes.

How to View
The setup is the same as Task 1. Simply open the index.html file for Task 2 in your browser or use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Deliverables
- index.html: HTML file for the To-Do list structure.

- style.css: CSS file for the app's visual design.

- script.js: JavaScript file containing all the functional logic.

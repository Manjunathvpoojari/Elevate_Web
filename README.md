# Web Development Internship Task 1: Responsive Landing Page

This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the Elevate Labs Web Development Internship. The objective was to create a simple, responsive landing page using fundamental web technologies.

## Project Overview

The task required building a clean and responsive landing page with three main sections:
* A **header** with a logo and navigation links.
* A **hero section** featuring a main heading, a paragraph, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.
* A **footer** with social links.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For structuring the page content and defining the elements.
* **CSS3**: For styling the page, including colors, fonts, and layout.
* **Flexbox**: Used for creating flexible and efficient layouts for both the header and the hero section.
* **Media Queries**: Implemented to ensure the page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, particularly for collapsing the navigation on smaller devices.
